# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/recyclarr/recyclarr/master/schemas/config-schema.json

# A starter config to use with Recyclarr. Most values are set to "reasonable defaults". Update the
# values below as needed for your instance. You will be required to update the API Key and URL for
# each instance you want to use.
#
# Many optional settings have been omitted to keep this template simple. Note that there's no "one
# size fits all" configuration. Please refer to the guide to understand how to build the appropriate
# configuration based on your hardware setup and capabilities.
#
# For any lines that mention uncommenting YAML, you simply need to remove the leading hash (`#`).
# The YAML comments will already be at the appropriate indentation.
#
# For more details on the configuration, see the Configuration Reference on the wiki here:
# https://recyclarr.dev/wiki/yaml/config-reference/
